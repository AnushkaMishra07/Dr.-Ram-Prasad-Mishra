<h2>  Dr. Ram Prasad Mishra was a man of versatile genius,
     much beyond the laid down restrictions of religion, languages,
     and even norms. A great poet, a remarkable novelist, a reputed 
     essayist, an immaculate critic who adorned almost all the branches
     of Hindi literature. He dedicated his entire life to the service
     of Hindi literature. He also made significant contributions in 
     English literature. He has more than hundred books to his credit.

</h2>
<h2>   He was born at Village Nimbai on the bank of river Ganga
     in Distt. Unnao of Uttar Pradesh on 19th September, 1932. His father Pt. 
     Shiv Lal Mishra belonged to Village Daulatpur Distt. Rai Bareilly, Uttar 
     Pradesh. This village was given as Gurudakshina to Ritikalin Pinglacharya 
     Kaviraj Sukhdev Mishra, an ancestor, by the king.  Even before Sukhdev Mishra 
     there had been reputed writers in the family. So, Dr. Ram Prasad Mishra got interest
      in literature, philosophy and hinduism through his ancestors. Acharya Mahavir 
      Prasad Dwivedi known as father of ‘Khadi Boli’ and to whom an entire yug in history
       of Hindi literature 'Dwivedi Yug' has been dedicated was also from Village Daulatpur.
